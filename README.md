# My Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio built with **React** and **TypeScript**. It features a **desktop-like interface** with draggable and resizable windows, and a menu that works like a taskbar.  

The portfolio is currently **paused** as I don’t have enough content yet. I’m using this project to **experiment with different technologies** and programming concepts, exploring what I enjoy the most and what I want to focus on for future projects.

## Features

- Desktop-style interface with draggable/resizable windows  
- Taskbar-like menu for navigation  
- Built with React + TypeScript  

## Status

**Paused / Work in progress** — Currently testing and learning new technologies to improve the portfolio and add content later.

## Future Improvements

- Add more content and projects  
- Enhance UI/UX  
- Make it fully responsive  
- Clean and optimize code
